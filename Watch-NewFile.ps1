.DESCRIPTION
    This sample automation runbook is designed to be used in a watcher task that
    looks for new files in a directory. When a new file is found, it calls the action
    runbook associated with the watcher task. It requires that a variable called "Watch-NewFileTimestamp"
    be created in automation account that is used to hold the timestamp of the last file processed.

.PARAMETER FolderPath
    Required. The name of a folder that you wish to watch for new files.

.PARAMETER Extension
    Optional. The extension of files that you want to filter on. Default is *.*

.PARAMETER Recurse
    Optional. Determines whether to look for all files under all directories or just the specific
    folder. Default is the folder only.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Watch-NewFile -FolderPath c:\FinanceFiles

.EXAMPLE
    .\Watch-NewFile -FolderPath c:\FinanceFiles -Extension "*.csv" -Recurse $True
